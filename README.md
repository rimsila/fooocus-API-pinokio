<img  src="./image.png" />

## Setup

- Go to pinokio app -> download with url -> copy & paste git url -> download
- Click install waiting finish setup

## Model download

- If you already have Fooocus installed, and it is work well, The recommended way is to reuse models, you just simple copy config.txt file from your local Fooocus folder to Fooocus-API root folder.

Use this method you will have both Fooocus and Fooocus-API running at the same time. And they operate independently and do not interfere with each other.

- If not have Fooocus installed you can run API it will auto download for you but model size are big around 6G for realistic

## Run Api
